# RibbonController-
500mm SoftPot/600mm Force Sensor sandwhich - Midi controller 
Code originally written by 'deanm1278' which I have altered in order to implement
a force sensitive resistor strip to control velocity and aftertouch values. 

Not yet implemented: 
I want to use the 100mm length of the fsr that isn't covered by the 500mm soft pot to trigger base note. 
To do this I realise that I need to change part of the sketch that looks to see if the softpot is being touched to determine 
whether a note should be played or not to check to see if the fsr is being touched and if ribbon is or isn't being touched. 
I would also like to add a potentiometer or two to set basic paramaters like base note, pb range, velocity range, octave range etc..
